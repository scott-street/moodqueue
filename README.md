> about/how to

moodqueue is a Next.js React web app that uses the Spotify Web API to generate queues based on the kind of music the user is in the mood for. moodqueue users can choose a mood (happy/sad, sleepy/party), a certain number of songs, and where they want moodqueue to build their queue from (saved songs, recommended, etc) to get a list of tracks that they can then preview 30 second clips of and/or edit to remove any unwanted items before sending out the final queue to Spotify.

> example use cases

moodqueue is great for all sorts of occasions and activities, like...

-   falling asleep to a great set of sleepy tunes
-   coming up with a great, boppin' queue for your party on short notice
-   finding the motivation to redo your homework after your dog ate it with an inspirational queue full of happy, energetic ragers
-   crying tears of joy after realizing that the days of spending hours and hours building playlists to fit all kinds of different moods are gone
-   literally everything else... maybe? absolutely.
